🏆 Corporate Workforce Intelligence & Decision Engine (CWIDE)
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world corporate analytics system built using SQL and Power BI to evaluate employee performance, compensation fairness, workload, and attrition risk.

The system helps organizations make data-driven workforce decisions such as:

identifying underpaid high performers

detecting burnout risks

predicting employee turnover

measuring productivity vs compensation

evaluating departmental workforce health

🧠 Business Questions Solved

Are employees paid fairly across roles and departments?

Who are the high performers and hidden talents?

Which employees are at risk of burnout or resignation?

How does workload impact performance?

Which departments have the highest attrition risk?

Are there gender or role-based pay gaps?
